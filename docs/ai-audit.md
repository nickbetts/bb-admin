# AI Audit — Betts & Burton Report Platform

**Document version:** 3.3  
**Audit date:** April 2026  
**Last updated:** April 2026  
**Scope:** Full codebase audit pass — corrected stale weaknesses in Sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.10; Section 6 rewritten to reflect all implemented work; two undocumented AI features added to inventory; Section 8 (Remaining Tasks) added

---

## Executive Summary

v3.3 is a full codebase audit pass. All stale ❌ weaknesses in Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.10 have been corrected to reflect what is actually in the code. Section 6 (Improvement Recommendations) has been rewritten — all P1, P2, and P3 items were already implemented. Two previously undocumented AI features have been added to the inventory. A new Section 8 (Remaining Tasks) consolidates every genuinely open gap.

v3.2 closed the final data gaps (Google Ads RSA assets, Meta audience demographics), improved prompt quality in 4 endpoints, increased Super-Summary token budget to 3,000, and wired report approval notes into `report-commentary` and `executive-summary`. The Section 4 table now has zero ❌ items.

v3.1 closed all data pipeline gaps.

**New in v3.3 (Audit pass):**

- Section 2.2 corrected: `super-summary` max_tokens weakness marked as FIXED (raised to 3,000 in v3.2)
- Section 2.3 corrected: all three stale ❌ weaknesses about `overview-narrative` channel coverage, e-commerce data, and `PlatformMetrics` type marked FIXED (done in v3.0)
- Section 2.10 corrected: four stale ❌ weaknesses about `strategy-document` model, KPI targets, previous docs context, and hard-coded channel keys all marked FIXED (done in v3.0/v3.1)
- Section 1 (AI Endpoint Inventory): two undocumented AI features added — `cron/snapshots` anomaly hypothesis generation and `reports/[id]/approve` action extraction
- Section 6 (Improvement Recommendations): completely rewritten — all P1, P2, and P3 items from previous versions were already implemented in code
- Section 8 (Remaining Tasks) added: consolidated list of every genuinely open gap

**New in v3.2:**

- `getGoogleAdsRSAAssets()` added to `google-ads.ts` — GAQL query fetches top 50 RSAs with headlines, descriptions, and ad-level performance (clicks, conversions, spend); included in Google Ads route cache and injected into `overview-narrative` via ApiCache lookup
- `getMetaAudienceDemographics()` added to `meta.ts` — Meta Insights API with `age,gender` breakdown; exposed as `?type=demographics` in Meta route; injected into `overview-narrative` via ApiCache
- `creative-intelligence` — added structured system prompt with platform-specific diagnostic guidance; `max_tokens` raised to 2,000
- `forecast` — added system prompt with forecasting methodology (confidence bands, seasonality, contradictory signals), was previously user-message-only
- `competitor-intelligence` — system prompt improved with specific analysis framework (quantify threat, identify growth trajectory, exploit gaps, primary vs secondary threats)
- `super-summary` — `max_tokens` raised from 2,000 → 3,000 in both streaming and non-streaming paths
- `report-commentary` — accepts optional `reportId`; fetches `report.approvalStatus` + `report.approvalNotes`; injects revision guidance into system prompt when status is `changes_requested`
- `executive-summary` — same approval notes wiring as report-commentary

**New in v3.1:**

- GA4 demographics + AI referrals now injected into `overview-narrative` and `chat` via ApiCache lookup
- Competitor context (`CompetitorSnapshot`) now injected into `overview-narrative` prompt
- Google Ads audience segments now extracted from ApiCache and injected into `overview-narrative`
- Meta `videoViews` + `videoCompletionRate` parsed from existing actions array in `getMetaAdsOverview`
- TikTok `avgVideoPlaySeconds` (avg play time proxy) added to `getTikTokAdsOverview`
- Core Web Vitals (CrUX) now fetched per URL origin in `landing-page-analysis` with 24h cache
- `ActionItem` (open + in-progress tasks) injected into `chat` system prompt
- `ClientCommunication` (last 5 comms) injected into `chat` system prompt
- Contracted hours (from `client.contractedHours` JSON) injected into `chat`
- Previous `StrategyDocument` (last 2: summary + KPI targets) injected into `strategy-document` for continuity
- Previous `BudgetRecommendation` (most recent) injected into `budget-advisor`

**New in v3.0:**

- Model routing: `strategy-document` and `root-cause` upgraded to **gpt-4o** (from gpt-4o-mini) with doubled token budgets (6,000 and 4,000 respectively)
- `executive-summary` now queries `ClientGoal` records and references goal progress; bullet count scales dynamically with section count; max_tokens increased from 450 → 700
- `budget-advisor` now accepts and injects `ecommerceData` (revenue, orders, AOV) as north-star context for budget recommendations
- `competitor-intelligence` now fetches client name + SEO domain, includes cross-competitor comparison context, and generates 600-token actionable insights (up from 200)
- `strategy-document` now fetches `ClientGoal` records and uses real KPI targets rather than AI-invented figures; channel strategy examples expanded to cover all 12 channel types; token budget doubled
- `attribution` `avgPosition` bug fixed — journey order now derived from explicit `journeyPosition` field, or estimated from touchpoints/spend (higher = upper funnel); `avgPosition` deprecated
- `chat` snapshot context pre-formatted into human-readable text (percentages, currency, multipliers) rather than raw JSON strings
- `forecast` snapshot prompt window increased from 20 to 40 periods
- `tools/page-analyser` fixed to use `getOpenAiClient()` (was reading `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY` directly, ignoring DB-stored key)
- `admin/api-status` `env.openai` stale field removed — the route already computed `openAiConfigured` correctly; redundant env-only bool dropped from response
- `alert_recommendations` personas expanded: added `woocommerce`, `shopify`, and `ecommerce` personas (YouTube, HubSpot, CallRail were already present — v2.0 audit was incorrect)
- **5 new endpoints** not inventoried in v2.0: `ai-visibility`, `blended-revenue`, `goal-benchmark`, `meeting-briefing`, `report-narrative` — total is now **23 AI endpoints**

**Total AI endpoints: 23**  
**Models:** `gpt-4o` for strategy-document and root-cause; `gpt-4o-mini` for all others  
**Key management:** All 23 endpoints use `getOpenAiClient()` from `src/lib/openai-client.ts` (checks DB `AppSetting` first, falls back to `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var).

## 2. Component-by-Component Audit

### 2.1 AiInsightsPanel (`/api/ai/summary`)

**What it does:**  
The workhorse per-channel AI panel. Appears on every data tab. Performs two jobs:

1. **Rules-engine anomaly detection** — pure algorithmic, no AI tokens used. Detects period-over-period metric changes, campaign-level structural issues (impression share, ROAS < 1x, ad frequency), and landing page zero-conversion situations.
2. **AI-generated insights** — GPT-4o-mini prompt containing account metrics, previous-period metrics, campaign breakdown, landing pages, historical snapshots, and cross-platform context.

**Data it receives:**

- ✅ Account-level metrics (current period)
- ✅ Previous period metrics (for deltas)
- ✅ Campaign-level enriched data (Google Ads: impression share, bid strategy, budget; Meta: frequency, ROAS, objective)
- ✅ Landing page URLs + clicks/impressions/conversions
- ✅ Historical snapshots (up to 6 periods via `/api/ai/snapshots`)
- ✅ Cross-platform context string (built in the dashboard component from other channel results)

**What the AI sees that a human analyst would want:**

- ✅ Specific campaign names and their ROAS/CPA
- ✅ Impression share loss (budget vs rank)
- ✅ Creative fatigue signals (frequency + CTR correlation)
- ✅ ROAS below 1x alert
- ✅ Landing page CVR = 0 flags

**What it's missing:**

- ❌ Audience/demographic breakdown data (age, gender, device split from Meta/GA4)
- ❌ Day-of-week / hour-of-day performance patterns (dayparting data)
- ❌ Ad creative format breakdown (image vs carousel vs video vs Reels)
- ❌ YouTube/HubSpot/CallRail/Klaviyo data not fed into cross-platform context
- ❌ Goals progress (is the client on-track for their KPI targets?)
- ❌ Historical anomaly pattern — was this same anomaly seen last quarter?
- ❌ Competitor benchmarking data (CompetitorSnapshot metrics)

**Channel personas for alert recommendations:**
A sophisticated feature — **13 distinct system prompts** exist: search_console/gsc, meta, google_ads, ga4, semrush, tiktok, microsoftads, linkedin, klaviyo, youtube, hubspot, callrail, woocommerce, shopify, ecommerce. YouTube, HubSpot, CallRail, WooCommerce, Shopify, and E-Commerce personas added in v3.0.

### 2.2 SuperSummary (`/api/ai/super-summary`)

**What it does:**  
A deeper, full-funnel narrative that physically crawls the top 5 landing pages (by click volume) and adds technical page signals (title, meta description, H1, CTAs, form count, trust signals, structured data, mobile viewport) to the context before sending to GPT.

This is the most sophisticated component — it bridges ad performance data with real on-page quality signals.

**Strengths:**

- ✅ Live page crawling via `fetchPageSignals` utility
- ✅ Full campaign-level data + cross-platform context
- ✅ Per-page health scoring (0–100) in the response
- ✅ Journey assessment (traffic → landing → conversion) as a distinct output field
- ✅ Prioritised action list focused on full-funnel impact

**Weaknesses:**

- ❌ Only covers `ga4`, `googleads`, `meta`, `seo`, `searchconsole` section types — not TikTok, LinkedIn, Microsoft Ads, Klaviyo, YouTube, HubSpot, CallRail
- ❌ Page crawl can fail silently (HTTPS-only sites, bot-blocking) — no fallback web search (unlike `landing-page-analysis` which uses OpenAI web_search for failed fetches)
- ❌ ~~gpt-4o-mini has 128k context but `max_tokens` is capped at 2,000 — very tight for 5-page crawls + campaign data + cross-platform context~~ ✅ FIXED (v3.2) — raised to 3,000 tokens in both streaming and non-streaming paths
- ❌ Landing page scoring gives one number (0–100) but doesn't drill into WHY (no CRO/SEO/Mobile/Forms breakdown like the dedicated `landing-page-analysis` endpoint does)
- ❌ No awareness of client goals — can't say "you're 60% of the way to your ROAS target"
- ❌ No Core Web Vitals data fed in — Google's actual field data on page performance not used here

---

### 2.3 CrossChannelOverview (`/api/ai/overview-narrative`)

**What it does:**  
Produces a strategic marketing narrative across ALL active channels simultaneously. Analyses budget allocation, channel synergy, full funnel, website health, and organic foundation.

**Strengths:**

- ✅ The most strategically coherent prompt in the system — the system prompt explicitly models 5 analytical frameworks (budget allocation, channel synergy, full funnel, website health, organic foundation)
- ✅ Includes aggregated paid totals (blended ROAS, blended CPA)
- ✅ Receives campaign highlights and computed anomaly alerts
- ✅ Channel efficiency matrix with health scores and trend %
- ✅ Provides `channelScores` (per-channel 0-100) + `overallScore` + `crossChannelInsights` + `budgetRecommendation`

**Weaknesses:**

- ❌ ~~Hard-coded to 5 channels: googleads, meta, ga4, seo, searchconsole. TikTok, Microsoft Ads, LinkedIn, Klaviyo, YouTube **not included in cross-channel analysis**~~ ✅ FIXED (v3.0) — `PlatformMetrics` type now covers all 12 channel types; `overview-narrative` route handles TikTok, Microsoft Ads, LinkedIn, Klaviyo, YouTube, HubSpot, CallRail, and ecommerce as optional blocks
- ❌ ~~No e-commerce revenue data (WooCommerce/Shopify orders, revenue, AOV) — a client's actual business revenue is invisible to the cross-channel AI~~ ✅ FIXED (v3.0) — `ecommerce` field added to `PlatformMetrics`; revenue/orders/AOV injected into context; `channelScores` key `ecommerce` supported
- ❌ ~~`PlatformMetrics` type is defined but only those 5 channels are explicitly typed~~ ✅ FIXED (v3.0) — all channels explicitly typed with per-channel metric shapes
- ❌ No seasonality context — the AI doesn't know if it's Christmas, Black Friday, or back-to-school
- ❌ Blended totals (totalAdSpend, totalPaidClicks, blendedRoas) are caller-assembled by the frontend — whether CallRail and Klaviyo are included in the blended numbers depends on what the client component passes in; there is no server-side guarantee

---

### 2.4 Report Commentary (`/api/ai/report-commentary`)

**What it does:**  
Generates client-facing section commentary for the report editor. Tone (5 options including the memorable "roadman"), length (short/medium/long), and format (prose/bullets/both) are all configurable.

**Strengths:**

- ✅ Reads `aiReportInstructions` from the client DB record — genuine per-client personalisation
- ✅ 5 tone options, 3 length options, 3 format options — good flexibility
- ✅ Strong system prompt discipline: never mention absence of channels, never say "unfortunately"
- ✅ First-person agency voice ("we saw", "our focus")

**Weaknesses:**

- ❌ Receives only account-level metrics (no campaign data, no landing pages) — commentary will always be more surface-level than AiInsightsPanel
- ❌ No previous-period context fed to the overview/intro section type
- ❌ Not linked to the client's goal progress — commentary could reference "we're 85% to your ROAS target"
- ❌ Tone options not exposed to the client portal (clients can't choose their preferred tone)
- ❌ No seasonal awareness — July commentary could reference school holidays for retail clients if we fed that context

---

### 2.5 Executive Summary (`/api/ai/executive-summary`)

**What it does:**  
Takes the already-generated section commentaries (text strings) and distils them into 4–6 executive bullet points.

**Strengths:**

- ✅ Reads `aiReportInstructions` from DB — personalised output
- ✅ Strong concision — caps input at 600 chars per section to avoid bloat

**Weaknesses:**

- ❌ Works on the commentary text, not the raw metrics — so it's summarising summaries, with data dilution
- ❌ ~~No awareness of the report's KPI goals~~ ✅ FIXED — `ClientGoal` data now injected; executive summary opens with goal progress
- ❌ ~~Output is always 4–6 bullets regardless of how many channels are active~~ ✅ FIXED — bullet count now scales dynamically (3–4 for ≤3 sections, 4–5 for 4–6, 5–7 for 7+)
- ❌ No sentiment signal — can't produce a more celebratory tone when all metrics are up

---

### 2.6 Performance Forecast (`/api/ai/forecast`)

**What it does:**  
Produces 30/60/90-day projections for sessions, conversions, revenue, spend, and ROAS with confidence bands.

**Strengths:**

- ✅ Uses `MetricSnapshot` historical data (up to 90 periods)
- ✅ Produces confidence bands (high/medium/low) based on data quality

**Weaknesses:**

- ❌ The prompt just dumps raw JSON snapshots — ~~no pre-processing~~ ✅ FIXED — `computeTrendAnalysis()` pre-processes full snapshot history (MoM, YoY, volatility) before the prompt
- ❌ No channel breakdown — forecasts sessions/conversions as single numbers. A marketer needs "GA4 sessions will be ±12%, Google Ads conversions will drop 8% due to seasonal CPC increases"
- ❌ ~~Only 20 snapshots sliced into the prompt despite fetching 90~~ ✅ FIXED — now slices up to 40 periods
- ❌ No awareness of upcoming seasonal events, planned campaigns, or budget changes
- ❌ The forecast data is not persisted to `MetricSnapshot` or any other model — forecasts are ephemeral
- ❌ No confidence calibration tracking — we never know if our forecasts were accurate

---

### 2.7 Budget Advisor (`/api/ai/budget-advisor`)

**What it does:**  
Analyses cross-channel spend efficiency and proposes reallocation with projected revenue impact.

**Strengths:**

- ✅ Saves to `BudgetRecommendation` model — historical tracking possible
- ✅ Produces per-channel recommended budget with current vs recommended comparison

**Weaknesses:**

- ❌ ~~Receives `channelMetrics` with no ecommerce context~~ ✅ FIXED — `ecommerceData` (revenue, orders, AOV) now accepted and injected as north-star context
- ❌ GPT-4o-mini is being asked to recommend specific £ budget amounts with no knowledge of what the client's actual total budget is or what their contracted spend is
- ❌ No awareness of contracted hours or agency fee structure — budget reallocation could conflict with the service agreement
- ❌ Recommendations are not linked to the Goals system — if the client has a CPA target, the budget advice should be oriented around achieving it
- ❌ No lifetime budget / monthly cap awareness — recommending doubling Meta budget when the client is on a fixed £2,000/month plan is useless

---

### 2.8 Attribution Modelling (`/api/ai/attribution`)

**What it does:**  
Computes 5 attribution models (Last Click, First Click, Linear, Time Decay, Position-Based) algorithmically in-code, then asks GPT to narrate the results.

**Strengths:**

- ✅ Attribution maths runs deterministically in TypeScript — correct and reliable
- ✅ AI adds narrative value explaining which channels are over/undervalued
- ✅ Uses `AppSetting` DB key (correct pattern for auth)

**Weaknesses:**

- ❌ ~~The model uses `avgPosition` to proxy channel order in the funnel~~ ✅ FIXED — attribution now uses explicit `journeyPosition` field when provided, or estimates from touchpoints/spend; `avgPosition` deprecated
- ❌ No actual journey data — real multi-touch attribution requires impression/click timestamps per session. We're computing estimated attribution on aggregated conversion counts
- ❌ ~~The AI narrative prompt is only 600 tokens~~ ✅ FIXED — increased to 800 with improved 4-point narrative structure
- ❌ No Data-Driven Attribution (DDA) model — Google uses ML-based DDA which agencies increasingly recommend
- ❌ Results not saved to any model — can't track how attribution picture changes over time

---

### 2.9 Creative Intelligence (`/api/ai/creative-intelligence`)

**What it does:**  
Analyses creative-level performance data for Meta or Google Ads, identifying patterns in top vs underperforming creatives and producing a creative brief.

**Strengths:**

- ✅ Slices top 30 creatives — good breadth
- ✅ Produces `pauseRecommendations` with specific creative names
- ✅ Produces a `creativeBrief` the team can act on immediately

**Weaknesses:**

- ❌ The creative data shape only accepts `{ name, spend, impressions, clicks, ctr, conversions, roas, format, headline, description }` — **no video performance data** (video views, completion rate, 3-second view rate, thumb-stop rate) — critical for TikTok and Meta Reels
- ❌ No image/thumbnail URL or creative visual described — AI can't know if a creative uses a person's face, a product shot, or text-on-image
- ❌ TikTok has its own creative endpoint but there's no `TikTokCreativeIntelligence` call
- ❌ For Google Ads, RSA (Responsive Search Ads) assets (individual headlines + descriptions with performance ratings) are not fed in — only campaign-level data
- ❌ No frequency data per creative — the most important fatigue signal is impressions per unique user per ad, not just aggregate frequency

---

### 2.10 Strategy Document (`/api/ai/strategy-document`)

**What it does:**  
Generates a 10-section quarterly strategy document per client.

**Strengths:**

- ✅ Broad scope — 10 sections covering performance, wins, challenges, competitor, opportunities, channel strategy, budget, content, technical, KPIs
- ✅ Saves to `StrategyDocument` model with optional share token
- ✅ Accepts `crossPlatformData` payload — can receive everything

**Weaknesses:**

- ❌ ~~Prompt uses `gpt-4o-mini` with `max_tokens: 3000` — a 10-section strategy document at this budget will inevitably be shallow, generic, and templated~~ ✅ FIXED (v3.0) — upgraded to `gpt-4o` with `max_tokens: 6000`
- ❌ `crossPlatformData` is `Record<string, unknown>` — the endpoint does not fetch live channel data itself; it relies on the caller to assemble the cross-platform payload. This is an architectural limitation — if a channel section hasn't been loaded by the user, its data won't be present.
- ❌ ~~KPI targets in the output use "current" and "target" as strings — completely invented by the AI rather than pulled from the actual `ClientGoal` records~~ ✅ FIXED (v3.0) — `ClientGoal` records are fetched and injected as `ACTIVE CLIENT GOALS (use these as the basis for kpiTargets — do NOT invent figures)`
- ❌ ~~No previous strategy documents context — each document is generated in isolation; it cannot say "last quarter we committed to X, here's how we did"~~ ✅ FIXED (v3.1) — last 2 `StrategyDocument` records (title, performanceSummary, kpiTargets) are injected as `PREVIOUS STRATEGY DOCUMENTS`
- ❌ ~~`channelStrategy` in the output has hard-coded keys: `paid_search`, `paid_social`, `seo`, `email`, `overall` — other channels (TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube, Display) get ignored~~ ✅ FIXED (v3.0) — prompt now uses dynamic keys based on channels actually present in `crossPlatformData`; prompt explicitly says "OMIT any channel not represented in the data"

---

### 2.11 Root Cause Analysis (`/api/ai/root-cause`)

**What it does:**  
Deep-dive investigation of a specific anomaly, pulling 12 periods of platform-specific history AND 30 cross-platform snapshots, then producing a structured 7-section root cause analysis.

**Strengths:**

- ✅ Best use of historical data in the platform — 12 platform-specific periods + 30 cross-channel periods
- ✅ Well-structured output (hypothesis, evidence, cross-channel correlation, historical context, confidence, actions, monitoring plan)
- ✅ Cross-channel correlation is genuine — checks all other platforms' snapshot data for correlated patterns

**Weaknesses:**

- ❌ ~~`gpt-4o-mini` at `max_tokens: 2000`~~ ✅ FIXED — upgraded to `gpt-4o` with `max_tokens: 4000`
- ❌ Output is plain Markdown text, not structured JSON — UI has to render raw text, making it harder to create interactive components (expandable sections, confidence badges, action items that link to the Actions system)
- ❌ No deduplication — if the same root cause is triggered multiple times for the same anomaly (user re-generates), all results are ephemeral; nothing is saved to the DB

---

### 2.12 Landing Page Analysis (`/api/ai/landing-page-analysis`)

**What it does:**  
Full CRO/SEO/Mobile/Forms audit of up to 10 URLs. For successful fetches, uses HTML signal extraction. For failed fetches (bot-blocking, HTTPS errors), falls back to OpenAI web_search_preview tool.

**Strengths:**

- ✅ The only endpoint that uses OpenAI's `responses.create` with `web_search_preview` tool — genuinely smarter than the others for real-world page analysis
- ✅ 4-dimensional scoring (CRO, SEO, Mobile, Forms) with per-category issues and recommendations
- ✅ Parallel processing of all URLs

**Weaknesses:**

- ❌ No integration with CrUX/Core Web Vitals data — the AI scores mobile readiness from HTML signals, not real user data
- ❌ No comparison to competitor pages — "your CTA density is lower than the top 3 Google results for your keyword"
- ❌ No heat map data, scroll depth, or session recording data — purely structural analysis
- ❌ Web search fallback calls `gpt-4o-mini` with `web_search_preview` but `gpt-4o-mini` may not always have internet access in all deployment environments
- ❌ Page signals fetcher (`fetchPageSignals`) has a 10-second timeout — legitimate slow pages just get `fetchError` and lose HTML analysis quality

---

### 2.13 AI Chat (`/api/ai/chat`)

**What it does:**  
Conversational interface preloaded with the client's `MetricSnapshot` history (last 30 records).

**Strengths:**

- ✅ Conversation history persisted in `ClientConversation` model
- ✅ Lists connected platforms in the system prompt so AI knows what data exists
- ✅ Multi-turn: last 10 messages passed as context on each turn
- ✅ Uses session-scoped DB key lookup pattern

**Weaknesses:**

- ❌ Context is limited to `MetricSnapshot` data — the chat AI cannot access live API data, only historical snapshots
- ❌ ~~Snapshots are raw JSON strings, not pre-formatted~~ ✅ FIXED — snapshots are now formatted as human-readable text (percentages, currency symbols, multipliers)
- ❌ The system prompt lists platform connections but **doesn't include their data** — just flags like "GA4" without any actual numbers
- ❌ No function calling / tool use — the chat could theoretically call `/api/ga4`, `/api/google-ads`, etc. live to answer real-time questions
- ❌ No memory beyond the current session — each conversation starts fresh apart from the last 50 messages
- ❌ No suggested follow-up questions generated — UI has static prompt suggestions that don't adapt to what the data actually shows

---

### 2.14 Competitor Intelligence (`/api/competitor-intelligence`)

**What it does:**  
Pulls SemRush domain overview metrics, saves to `CompetitorSnapshot`, and generates 2-3 sentences of AI insight.

**Weaknesses:**

- ❌ ~~Only 200 max tokens for competitor analysis~~ ✅ FIXED — increased to 600 tokens with specific, actionable prompt
- ❌ ~~No cross-competitor comparison~~ ✅ FIXED — other tracked competitor snapshots now included as context
- ❌ ~~No client context~~ ✅ FIXED — client name and SEO domain included in prompt
- ❌ Single-domain POST still generates one analysis at a time — a dedicated "compare all competitors" endpoint/view would be more useful

---

### 2.15 Media Plan Forecast (`/api/tools/media-plan/[id]/forecast`)

**What it does:**  
Generates per-channel projected metrics (impressions, clicks, CTR, conversions, CPA, CPM) for a planned media schedule.

**Weaknesses:**

- ❌ No historical client performance data fed in — AI is forecasting in a vacuum with no benchmarks
- ❌ Industry benchmarks not included — the AI has no knowledge of typical CTRs, CPMs, or CPAs for the client's sector
- ❌ No competitive intelligence context — CPMs on TikTok are higher in Q4; the AI doesn't know this without being told
- ❌ Forecast saved to `MediaPlan.forecast` JSON but not linked to `MetricSnapshot` — no way to compare actual vs forecast post-campaign

Cross-platform context flow:
Each section passes its summary metrics to ClientDashboard
ClientDashboard builds crossPlatformContext string from all loaded sections
This string is passed to each section's AiInsightsPanel / SuperSummary
```

**Snapshot persistence flow:**

- `MetricSnapshot` is written after every section load (upsert by clientId+sectionType+period)
- `/api/ai/snapshots` (GET) returns last 6–12 periods for a client+section
- `/api/ai/forecast`, `/api/ai/root-cause`, `/api/ai/chat` all query `MetricSnapshot` directly from DB
- `BudgetRecommendation` and `StrategyDocument` are the only AI outputs that persist to DB

## 5. Current Gaps & Weaknesses

### 5.1 Critical Gaps

**1. ~~No goal awareness across any AI component~~** ✅ FIXED (v3.0)  
`ClientGoal` data is now injected into summary, overview-narrative, report-commentary, executive-summary, and strategy-document.

**2. ~~E-commerce revenue is invisible~~** ✅ FIXED (v3.0)  
E-commerce data (revenue, orders, AOV) is now fed into overview-narrative, budget-advisor, forecast, and report-commentary.

**3. ~~TikTok/LinkedIn/YouTube/HubSpot/CallRail excluded from cross-channel AI~~** ✅ FIXED (v3.0)  
All 12 channel types are now supported in overview-narrative. YouTube, HubSpot, and CallRail have AiInsightsPanel on their dashboard tabs.

**4. ~~Model used everywhere: gpt-4o-mini~~** ✅ PARTIALLY FIXED (v3.0)  
`strategy-document` and `root-cause` now use `gpt-4o` with doubled token budgets.

**5. ~~Per-client AI instructions only used in 2/18 endpoints~~** ✅ FIXED (v3.0)  
Now injected into all 10 relevant AI endpoints.

**6. ~~Data pipeline gaps — demographics, audience, video metrics, CWV, comms, actions~~** ✅ FIXED (v3.1/v3.2)  
All data connections are now wired in. Section 4 table has zero ❌ items.

**7. No AI output quality feedback loop**  
There is no mechanism for users to rate AI outputs (thumbs up/down, edit, reject). Without this signal, prompts cannot be improved based on real-world usage. Anomaly detection thresholds (>15%, >30%, >50%) were set once and never adjusted.

**8. ~~No streaming~~** ✅ FIXED (v3.0)  
strategy-document, super-summary, root-cause, and overview-narrative now support `stream: true` for SSE streaming.

**9. ~~API key management inconsistency~~** ✅ FIXED (v3.0)  
All 23 endpoints now use `getOpenAiClient()`. `tools/page-analyser` was the last holdout.

**10. ~~Prompt quality variance~~** ✅ FIXED (v3.2)  
`creative-intelligence`, `forecast`, and `competitor-intelligence` previously had no/minimal system prompts. All three now have structured, opinionated system prompts with specific analytical frameworks.

---

### 5.2 Structural Weaknesses

**Prompt quality variance (remaining):**

- All key endpoints now have structured system prompts
- `budget-advisor` prompt is comprehensive (detailed instructions, campaign formatting, JSON schema)
- Minor: `forecast` still has no channel-level breakdown — single aggregated numbers rather than per-channel projections

**Token budget constraints (remaining):**

- `executive-summary`: ~~450~~ → **700 tokens** ✅
- `competitor-intelligence`: ~~200~~ → **600 tokens** ✅
- `strategy-document`: ~~3,000~~ → **6,000 tokens** ✅
- `root-cause`: ~~2,000~~ → **4,000 tokens** ✅
- `forecast`: 2,000 tokens (appropriate given structured JSON output size)
- `super-summary`: ~~2,000~~ → **3,000 tokens** ✅

**No AI output quality feedback loop** — still open. Requires new DB model + UI rating component.

**No caching or deduplication:**  
Every button press fires a fresh API call. Identical requests (same client, same period, same data) hit OpenAI repeatedly. A hash-based cache on the prompt context could save significant cost.

## 7. What If: Claude Sonnet / Opus Integration

### 7.1 Current State

Every AI call in the platform uses OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini`. The OpenAI Node.js SDK is used throughout, with a consistent client pattern. The dependency is:

```json
"openai": "^4.x"
```

### 7.2 Claude API: What's Different

Anthropic's Claude API (available via `@anthropic-ai/sdk`) uses a similar REST pattern to OpenAI but with key structural differences:

| Aspect         | OpenAI (current)                           | Claude Sonnet/Opus                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SDK            | `openai` npm                               | `@anthropic-ai/sdk` npm                                                                                                |
| Message format | `{ role, content }`                        | `{ role, content }` (similar)                                                                                          |
| System prompt  | `messages[0].role = "system"`              | Separate `system` parameter                                                                                            |
| Streaming      | `stream: true` in `create()`               | `stream()` method                                                                                                      |
| JSON mode      | `response_format: { type: "json_object" }` | Requires prompt instruction (no native JSON mode in claude-3.x; claude-3-5-sonnet+ has tool use for structured output) |
| Max tokens     | `max_tokens`                               | `max_tokens` (same)                                                                                                    |
| Context window | 128k (gpt-4o-mini)                         | 200k (Sonnet/Opus) — **56% more**                                                                                      |
| Cost (input)   | ~$0.15/1M tokens                           | Sonnet 3.5: ~$3/1M tokens (20× more)                                                                                   |
| Cost (output)  | ~$0.60/1M tokens                           | Sonnet 3.5: ~$15/1M tokens (25× more)                                                                                  |

### 7.3 What Claude Sonnet Would Unlock

**Claude Sonnet 3.5 / 3.7 strengths that matter for marketing AI:**

1. **Longer coherent documents** — strategy documents, comprehensive quarterly reviews, multi-channel narratives — Claude produces substantially more coherent long-form text than gpt-4o-mini.
2. **Better instruction following for complex prompts** — the overview-narrative and super-summary prompts are long and nuanced. Claude Sonnet has notably better adherence to complex, multi-constraint instructions.
3. **200k context window** — pass full 12-month MetricSnapshot history, all competitor snapshots, all active goals, all previous strategy documents, and full campaign data in a single prompt without chunking.
4. **Claude Opus 4 / 4.5 for strategic reasoning** — Opus-class models demonstrate markedly better causal reasoning, most affecting root-cause analysis and strategy documents.
5. **Reduced hallucination on numerical tasks** — Claude Sonnet hallucinates specific numbers less often than gpt-4o-mini under constrained prompts.

### 7.4 Proposed Hybrid Architecture

| Task                               | Current     | Proposed               | Rationale                                             |

### 7.5 Implementation Path

**Approach A: Drop-in replacement (low risk, 1–2 days)**

```typescript
// lib/ai-client.ts
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";
import OpenAI from "openai";

export async function createAICompletion(options: {
  model?: "gpt-4o-mini" | "claude-sonnet" | "claude-opus";
  systemPrompt: string;
  userPrompt: string;
  maxTokens: number;
  jsonMode?: boolean;
  temperature?: number;
}): Promise<string> {
  const provider = await getAIProvider(); // "openai" | "claude"

  if (provider === "claude") {
    const client = new Anthropic({ apiKey: await getClaudeKey() });
    const response = await client.messages.create({
      model: options.model === "claude-opus" ? "claude-opus-4-5" : "claude-sonnet-4-5",
      max_tokens: options.maxTokens,
      system: options.systemPrompt + (options.jsonMode ? "\n\nRespond with valid JSON only." : ""),
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: options.userPrompt }],
      temperature: options.temperature ?? 0.3,
    });
    return response.content[0].type === "text" ? response.content[0].text : "";
  }

  const client = new OpenAI({ apiKey: await getOpenAIKey() });
  const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: options.systemPrompt },
      { role: "user", content: options.userPrompt },
    ],
    max_tokens: options.maxTokens,
    temperature: options.temperature ?? 0.3,
    ...(options.jsonMode ? { response_format: { type: "json_object" as const } } : {}),
  });
  return response.choices[0]?.message?.content ?? "";
}
```

**Approach B: Per-task model selection (moderate risk, 1–2 weeks)**

Add a `model` field to the AppSetting UI that allows selecting per-task model routing — "Fast" tasks always use gpt-4o-mini, "deep analysis" tasks use Claude Sonnet, "strategic documents" use Claude Opus.

**Approach C: A/B routing with quality scoring (advanced, 4–6 weeks)**

Run identical prompts against both models for high-stakes requests, ask a lightweight model to score both outputs (0–10 on specificity, accuracy, actionability), return the higher-scoring result, and log the comparison to improve routing decisions over time.

### 7.6 What Is Genuinely Possible with Claude Opus

1. **A genuinely persuasive quarterly strategy document** — properly argued narrative that sounds like a senior strategist wrote it.
2. **Real root cause analysis that follows causal chains** — "Your CPA rose because budget ran out on day 18, which pushed spend to brand terms (lower intent), which reduced conversion rate, which in turn appears to have triggered Smart Bidding's learning phase to reset."
3. **Multi-document synthesis** — pass the last 4 strategy documents, 6 months of snapshots, the current goals, and the client's AI instructions.
4. **Creative brief that learns from past** — identify non-obvious creative patterns across 6 months of data.
5. **Proactive client communication drafts** — "Based on this month's performance, here's a draft email to the client explaining the CPA increase with proposed remediation steps."

---

_This document should be reviewed and updated quarterly. Prompt quality improvements should be version-controlled alongside code changes. AI output quality metrics should be tracked systematically once a rating mechanism is implemented._

## 8. Remaining Tasks

> This section combines every genuinely open gap across the entire platform as of v3.3. Items are grouped by theme and prioritised. "Quick wins" are ≤ 1 day of dev effort; "medium" are 2–5 days; "large" are 1–3 weeks.

---

### 8.1 Feedback & Quality

**RT-01 — AI output quality feedback loop** _(Large)_  
No mechanism exists for users to mark AI output as useful, wrong, or edited. Required: new `AiOutputFeedback` DB model (endpointName, clientId, rating, editedOutput, createdAt), a thumbs up/down + optional text UI component, and an admin analytics view showing rating trends per endpoint.

**RT-02 — Prompt output caching / deduplication** _(Medium)_  
Every button press fires a fresh OpenAI API call even if the same client + period + data has been requested before. A hash of the serialised prompt context stored in `ApiCache` with a short TTL (e.g. 1h) would cut costs and improve perceived performance. Particularly high value for `overview-narrative` and `strategy-document`.

---

### 8.2 Data & Context Gaps

**RT-03 — Budget Advisor: no ClientGoal awareness** _(Quick win)_  
`budget-advisor` fetches client name and instructions but never queries `ClientGoal`. Adding a goals context block would orient budget recommendations around hitting the client's actual CPA/ROAS targets.

**RT-04 — Budget Advisor: no total budget / contracted spend** _(Quick win)_  
The endpoint recommends specific daily budgets with no knowledge of the client's total available budget or contracted media spend.

**RT-05 — EcommerceSection: no AiInsightsPanel** _(Quick win)_  
`woocommerce`, `shopify`, and `ecommerce` personas exist in `SECTION_CONFIGS` in `summary/route.ts` but `EcommerceSection.tsx` does not render `AiInsightsPanel`.

**RT-06 — Seasonality context in AI prompts** _(Medium)_  
No endpoint currently tells the AI what time of year it is or what seasonal events are upcoming.

**RT-07 — SuperSummary: missing channel coverage** _(Medium)_  
`SECTION_NAMES` and `METRIC_LABELS` in `super-summary/route.ts` only define entries for `ga4`, `googleads`, `meta`, `seo`, `searchconsole`. Clients using TikTok, Microsoft Ads, LinkedIn, Klaviyo, YouTube, HubSpot, or CallRail cannot use SuperSummary on those tabs.

**RT-08 — SuperSummary: no Core Web Vitals data** _(Quick win)_  
SuperSummary crawls landing pages but never pulls CrUX/CWV data despite it being available via `getCoreWebVitals()`.

**RT-09 — SuperSummary: no ClientGoal awareness** _(Quick win)_  
SuperSummary never references the client's active goals.

**RT-10 — Overview-narrative: blended totals not server-guaranteed** _(Medium)_  
The `aggregated` object is assembled by the frontend. If a channel section hasn't been loaded, its data is absent. Moving blended totals calculation server-side (reading from `ApiCache`) would make the numbers deterministic.

---

### 8.3 Model & Output Quality

**RT-11 — Forecast: no per-channel breakdown** _(Medium)_  
The forecast endpoint projects sessions/conversions/revenue as single aggregated numbers. Per-channel projections would make forecasts operationally useful.

**RT-12 — Forecast: results not persisted** _(Quick win)_  
Every forecast is ephemeral — generated on demand, never stored.

**RT-13 — Attribution: no Data-Driven Attribution model** _(Large)_  
Adding a DDA approximation (Shapley value across touchpoints) would make the attribution module more credible.

**RT-14 — Attribution: results not saved to DB** _(Quick win)_  
Attribution model results are computed on demand and discarded.

**RT-15 — Root cause: plain Markdown output** _(Medium)_  
`root-cause` returns a plain Markdown string. Migrating to structured JSON would unlock a significantly better UI.

**RT-16 — Creative Intelligence: no video performance metrics** _(Medium)_  
The `creative` data shape has no video metrics (thumb-stop rate, 3-second view rate, video completion rate, hook watch time).

**RT-17 — Creative Intelligence: no TikTok-specific analysis** _(Medium)_  
No dedicated TikTok creative path exists. TikTok creative analysis requires different vocabulary and TikTok-specific fatigue signals.

---

### 8.4 Chat & Conversational AI

**RT-18 — Chat: context limited to MetricSnapshot only** _(Large)_  
Adding function calling (`tools`) that can call `/api/ga4`, `/api/google-ads`, and `/api/meta` on demand would transform the chat from a historical analysis tool into a genuine real-time assistant.

**RT-19 — Chat: no suggested follow-up questions** _(Quick win)_  
After each AI response, generating 2–3 contextual follow-up questions would significantly improve engagement.

---

### 8.5 AiInsightsPanel (summary endpoint)

**RT-20 — AiInsightsPanel: no demographic/audience breakdown** _(Medium)_  
Meta age×gender data now exists via `getMetaAudienceDemographics()` (v3.2) but it is only fed into `overview-narrative`, not into the per-channel AiInsightsPanel.

**RT-21 — AiInsightsPanel: no goal progress** _(Quick win)_  
Each channel's AiInsightsPanel prompt does not include the client's active goals.

**RT-22 — AiInsightsPanel: no historical anomaly pattern** _(Quick win)_  
When anomaly detection flags a metric change, the AI doesn't know whether this is a first-time occurrence or a recurring pattern.

---

### 8.6 Report & Document Workflow

**RT-23 — Report Commentary: no previous-period context for intro sections** _(Quick win)_  
The `overview`/`intro` section type does not receive previous-period metrics even though they are stored.

**RT-24 — Report Commentary: no seasonal context** _(Quick win)_  
Commentary generated in December could reference "the upcoming Christmas trading peak" only if the AI knows the current date and client sector.

---

### 8.7 Architecture & Infrastructure

**RT-25 — Claude Sonnet/Opus model routing** _(Large)_  
See Section 7 for full analysis. Implementation via a `createAICompletion()` abstraction in `src/lib/ai-client.ts` that routes based on task type and a per-task `AppSetting`.

**RT-26 — Media Plan Forecast: no historical benchmarks** _(Medium)_  
`/api/tools/media-plan/[id]/forecast` generates projections with no knowledge of the client's actual historical CTRs, CPMs, or CPAs.

**RT-27 — Keyword-overlap endpoint not surfaced in AI** _(Quick win)_  
`/api/cross/keyword-overlap` identifies paid/organic cannibalisation but this data is only shown in a UI panel. Injecting the high-risk cannibalisation pairs into the SEO `AiInsightsPanel` prompt would make it a much stronger strategic insight.
